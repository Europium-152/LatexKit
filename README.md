# LatexKit
LatexKit is a Google Sheets Add-on.
If you are just looking for latex table generation from Google Spreadsheets, you can install it from the [Google Sheets Add-on Store] or visit our [Facebook page].

Soon we hope to have here more information :). We are new to GitHub, therefore it might take some time... but any feedback is already welcome :D
